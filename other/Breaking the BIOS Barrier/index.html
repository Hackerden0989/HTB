	<h2>Step 2: Get Your Master Password</h2>
	<p>After you’ve provided the necessary information, biosbug.com will generate a master password for your computer. This password is unique to your computer and can only be used to unlock the BIOS on that specific machine.</p>
	<h2>Step 3: Enter the Master Password</h2>
	<p>Once you’ve received the master password, you’ll need to enter it into your computer’s BIOS. To do this, restart your computer and enter the BIOS setup menu. Depending on your computer’s brand and model, you may need to press a specific key, such as F2 or Delete, to access the BIOS setup menu.</p>
	<h2>Step 4: Remove the BIOS Password</h2>
